## ⏳ Sites To Add (When Ready)

### **Croma.com** - Partial support
- **Status:** Loads HTML but complex structure
- **Challenge:** Product links buried in heavy JavaScript
- **Plan:** Needs advanced HTML parsing or browser automation

### **Vijay Sales** - Partial support
- **Status:** Loads HTML
- **Challenge:** Similar to Croma - dynamic content
- **Plan:** Needs testing & refinement

### **Decathlon.in** - Blocked

## 💡 Recommendation

**For now: Keep Amazon-only**

Why?
- **Reliable:** Works consistently
- **Fast:** No bot detection issues
- **Comprehensive:** Finds 3 products per search
- **Quality:** Amazon has vast inventory

**Future expansion:**
1. Test Croma/Vijay Sales with browser automation
2. Add other bot-friendly sites based on testing
3. Consider API integrations for blocked sites

## 📊 Current Capability

The skill now:
✅ Searches Amazon for a product  
✅ Finds top 3 results  
✅ Analyzes each for trustworthiness  
✅ Compares prices & scores  
✅ Recommends best deal  

**This is already quite useful!** Most Indian e-commerce volume is on Amazon anyway.

## 🔧 If You Want More Sites

I can:
1. **Add browser automation** (requires Chrome extension connection)
2. **Focus on specific categories** (e.g., electronics-only sites)
3. **Add regional sites** (e.g., Reliance Digital, Vijay Sales physical stores)
